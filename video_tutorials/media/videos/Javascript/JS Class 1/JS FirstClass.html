<h1 align=center>JS First Class </h1>
<pre>
<!-- HTML- Layout/Structure of the webpage
	Tags & Attributes
CSS- Look & Feel of the webpage Elements
	property:value
Bootstrap- Responsive WebSite
	Predefined Classes

	1)Static website
2)Dynamic website-Event handling, form validation etc.

JS- Dynamic Website
	Means handle Events done by user and Form Validation
			object.method() or object.property

JS is Object Based language
______________________________
1)Object on which event done???
2)Event??? 
3)which Object will react???
4)What to do??   search for
	object.property
	object.method()
	object.property.method()
_____________________________________
Events done by user-

1)Keyboard----oninput,onchange,onkeypress,onkeyup,onkeydown etc.
2)Mouse---onclick,onmouseover,onmouseout,ondblclick etc.
3)window---onload,onunload,onscroll,onresize
4)Form---onchange,onfocus,onblur,oninput etc.

2 types of Script language

1)Client-side: Client-side scripting languages focus on the parts of a website or web application that the end user (or client) interacts with directly,don't need any server. eg. Javascript,VBscript

2)Server-side: Server-side scripting languages interact directly with and run on the server. These scripts are typically invisible to the end user.So it needs any web server with web browser to work. eg. PHP,Python,JAVA etc.

JS is a Mother language ,and developed many frameworks and library files eg.
 React JS, Angular JS, NodeJS,ViewJS,NextJS,ExpressJS, Jquery etc.
__________________________________
JS Rules-

1)case sensitive language.   almost in small-case, but some methods and properties are in camelcase. eg. document.getElementById
2)end each statement with ; but not mandatory ,use only when write statements in a single line
3)JS is object based language. Every object has some properties and methods.

 eg.car-object
color,price,model---property
start,stop----methods(functions)
________________________________

JS is Interpreter based language -

Computer understands only machine(binary language) language means 0,1 so we need any translator to convert the high lang code into machine language 

Translator-1)Compiler 2)Interpreter

Compiler - Translates whole source code into machine lang at once eg. c,c++
Interpreter - It will translate the code line by line

__________________________________________________
There are two types  of comments in JavaScript.

Single-line Comment-      //
Multi-line Comment-      /*             */

__________________________________________
Three Places to put JavaScript code
1At the end of the body tag of html 
2.Between the head tag of html but recommended to give in body part at the end of body part
3.In seperate .js file (external javaScript) and link that file  at the end of body
_________________________________________

External file of JS -
Advantages of External JavaScript file--
There will be following benefits if a user creates an external javascript:
It helps in the reusability of code in more than one HTML file.
It allows easy code readability.
It is time-efficient as web browsers cache the external js files, which further reduces the page loading time.
It enables both web designers and coders to work with html and js files parallelly and separately, i.e., without facing any code conflictions.
The length of the code reduces as only we need to specify the location of the js file.

Disadvantages of External JavaScript--

There are the following disadvantages of external files:
The stealer may download the coder's code using the url of the js file.
If two js files are dependent on one another, then a failure in one file may affect the execution of the other dependent file.

Output methods in JS
1)document.write()
2)console.log()
3)window.alert()/ alert()
4)innerHTML 

-->

</pre>

<div class=hello id="ddd">This is Div </div>
<br>
<button onclick="document.getElementById('ddd').innerHTML='Wow....Div content is changed'
">Change Content of Div</button>


<!-- Internal JS -->
<script type="text/javascript">
	// Methods of output	
// 1. document.write()-display in body
		// You can use any HTML tag in document.write
	document.write("<h3 >Output Method- 1. document.write()</h3>")
	document.write("Hello....First Class of JS")
//2. console.log()-press f12 to see the info in console,use for debugging by programmer only , not for user

	console.log("This is Console ")

// 3. alert()-display in seperate popup or window.alert() bcoz alert is method of window object
alert("Wow!...");
window.alert("Very Interesting...")
// document.getElementById("ddd").innerHTML="Wow....Div content is changed"

</script>
