<!-- Semantic & non-Semantic Tags

A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. Examples of non-semantic elements: div ,nav,header , footer ,section and span etc.- Tells nothing about its content to the browser. Examples of semantic elements: form , table , and article- Clearly defines its content.
_______________________________	
Block & Inline Tags-
Block- eg. h1-h6,p,div etc., They will block the entire line of tag
Inline- img,a ,input, span etc.
___________________________________
Container tags
Eg. div,section etc. are container tags bcoz they can contain all its child elements with it either block level / Inline Elements
P tag is not a container(parent) tag. Becoz it cannot contain block level elements
_______________________________
 Paired / Unpaired Tags
 Paired tags require an opening tag that turns a formatting feature on and a closing tag that turns the feature off. Paired tags must surround the text you want formatted with that feature. For example, <u> and </u> will underline text. You must include the slash ( / ) in the closing tag in order for the pair to work.

Unpaired tags work alone, and are usually placed before the text you want formatted.
