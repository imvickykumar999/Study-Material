<h2 > MEASUREMENT UNITS </h2>

<pre>
There are two types of length units: Absolute and Relative.

1.Absolute Lengths
The absolute length units are fixed and a length expressed in any 
of these will appear as exactly that size.

Absolute length units are not recommended for use on screen, because screen sizes may vary(can change) so much. However, they can be used if the output medium is known, such as for print layout.

Unit				Description
cm					centimeters
mm					millimeters
in					inches (1in = 96px = 2.54cm,  1in=72 points)
px 					pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in)
pt					points (1pt = 1/72 of 1 in)
pc					picas (1pc = 12 pt)
* Pixels (px) are relative to the viewing device. For low-dpi devices, 1px is one device pixel (dot) of the display. For printers and high resolution screens 1px implies multiple device pixels.

2.Relative Lengths
Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property. Relative length units scale better between different rendering medium.

Unit			Description	
em				Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means
				 2 times the size of the current font)	
rem				Relative to font-size of the root element	

ex				Relative to the x-height of the current font (rarely used)	
ch				Relative to the width of the "0" (zero)	
vw				Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport*	
vh				Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport*	
vmin			Relative to 1% of viewport's* smaller dimension	
vmax			Relative to 1% of viewport's* larger dimension	
%	Relative to the parent element	
Tip: The em and rem units are practical in creating perfectly scalable layout!
* Viewport = the browser window size. If the viewport is 50cm wide, 1vw = 0.5cm.
