<h3>What is mailto link</h3>
<pre>
Mailto link is a type of HTML link that activates the default mail client on the computer for sending an e-mail.
The web browser requires a default e-mail client software installed on his computer in order to activate the e-mail client.
If you have Microsoft Outlook, for example as your default mail client, pressing a mailto link will open a new mail window.
